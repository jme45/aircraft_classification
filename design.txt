Title: Aircraft classifier
Description: A module for building an aircraft classifier, where I focus on civilian airliners.
The module builds an aircraft dataset based on the FGVAircraft dataset.
It then builds a classifier model using transfer learning, where different
pre-trained models can be loaded.

Objects: AircraftData(Dataset):

             init
         AircraftClassifier(nn.Module):
            init
                self.model
                self.transform
            predict()
